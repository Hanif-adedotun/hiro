### Test Cases for Order Handler

The following test cases are generated for the Order handler functions.

#### TestOrderCreate
*   Test case to check if the Create function returns a 201 status code when a valid order is created.

*   **Note**: The List function is currently not implemented.
#### TestOrderGetByID
*   Test case to check if the GetbyID function returns a 200 status code when an order is retrieved by ID.
*   **Note**: The GetbyID function is currently not implemented.
#### TestOrderUpdateByID
*   Test case to check if the UpdatebyID function returns a 200 status code when an order is updated by ID.
*   **Note**: The UpdatebyID function is currently not implemented.
#### TestOrderDeleteByID

# Testing the Application
The following tests are written to ensure that the application is functioning correctly. The tests cover the `Start`, `loadRoutes`, and `loadOrderRoute` functions.
## TestApp_Start
This test ensures that the `Start` function does not return an error when the application is started.
## TestApp_loadRoutes
This test ensures that the `loadRoutes` function does not return an error and the `router` is not nil after the function is called.
## TestApp_loadOrderRoute
This test ensures that the `loadOrderRoute` function does not return an error and the `router` is not nil after the function is called.

To run the tests, navigate to the directory containing the test files and run `go test`. Make sure the Postgres database is running and the environment variables are set accordingly. The tests will check if the server starts correctly and if the routes are loaded as expected. If any test fails, it will output an error message describing the failure. Please make sure the test database is properly configured and the necessary dependencies are installed.
